# modules (like writecache) are installed off the search path, so copy them
# to where they can be found. It seems like snmpsim gets installed with some
# basic MIBs as well - these are removed from the image since their existence
# appears to interfere with the proper loading and usage of the .snmpwalk files
# that we define for the emulator.
